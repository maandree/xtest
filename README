NAME
	xtest - test file types and permissions of multiple files

SYNOPSIS
	xtest [-0bcdefghkLprSstuwx] [+bcdefghkLprSstuwx] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
	xtest tests the file types and permissions of each specified
	file, if not file has been specified, a list file is read
	from stdin.

	All files that pass at least on of the tests are printed to
	stdout.

OPTIONS
	-0	Use NUL byte instead of <newline> to delimit files in
		both the input and the output.

	-f | -d | -p | -hL | -S | -b | -c
		File exists and is a (regular file [-f] | directory
		[-d] | named pipe [-p] | symbolic link [-h | -L] |
		socket [-S] | block special [-b] | character special
		[-c]).

	-k | -g | -u | -r | -w | -x
		File exists and has (sticky(1) [-k] | setgid(2) [-g] |
		setuid(4) [-u] | read(4) [-r] | write(2) [-w] |
		execute(1) [-x]) permissions.

	-t
		Input is an file descriptor and is associated with a
		terminal.

	+f | +d | +p | +hL | +S | +b | +c
		File does not exist or is not a (regular file [+f] |
		directory [+d] | named pipe [+p] | symbolic link [+h |
		+L] | socket [+S] | block special [+b] | character
		special [+c]).

	+k | +g | +u | +r | +w | +x
		File does not exist or does not has (sticky(1) [+k] |
		setgid(2) [+g] | setuid(4) [+u] | read(4) [+r] |
		write(2) [+w] | execute(1) [+x]) permissions.

	+t
		Input is not a file descriptor or is not associated
		with a terminal.

RATIONALE
	+-flags are included because it is too cumbersome to use
	comm(1).

	Only one test need to pass because this allows the user to
	represent the required condition in conjunctive normal form
	by pipe together multiple instances of xtest for conjunction.
	Disjunctive normal form is not as simple.
